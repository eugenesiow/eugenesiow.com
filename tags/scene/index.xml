      <description>A broad cross-IoT study of the characteristics of Things schemata and data streams. The aim of the study is to determine the flatness, width, types of attribute values and periodicity of current IoT data streams from various domains and use cases.
There are individual README.md files describing each of the datasets and the files within the dataset in more detail.

      <description>A collection of IoT schemata to determine the characteristics of IoT data. The focus was on whether IoT data was complex or flat, wide or narrow, numerical or non-numerical and even or unevenly spaced.
There were 22,662 schemata collected in Jan2016 of which 1,541 are empty and 9,561 are non-IoT schemata (dweet.zip).
Each schema is a .json file and they are classified into folders (complex, empty, flat).
Additional collected content (available in Apr 2017) of dweets is in another file called dweet_content.</description>
