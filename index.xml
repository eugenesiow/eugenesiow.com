      <description>Abstract This thesis is concerned with the development of efficient methods for managing contextualised time-series data and event streams produced by the Internet of Things (IoT) so that both historical and real-time information can be utilised to generate value within analytical applications.
From a database systems perspective, two conflicting challenges motivate this research, interoperability and performance. IoT applications integrating streams of time-series data from heterogeneous IoT agents require a level of semantic interoperability.</description>

      <title>Ewya: An Interoperable Fog Computing Infrastructure with RDF Stream Processing</title>
      <link>http://eugenesiow.com/publications/eywa/</link>

      <description>Abstract Fog computing is an emerging technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) that aims to support processing on resource-constrained distributed nodes in between the sensors and actuators on the ground and compute clusters in the cloud. Fog Computing benefits from low latency, location awareness, mobility, wide-spread deployment and geographical distribution at the edge of the network. However, there is a need to investigate, optimise for and measure the performance, scalability and interoperability of resource-constrained Fog nodes running real-time applications and queries on streaming IoT data before we can realise these benefits.</description>

      <description>Poster Abstract The Web Observatory is a system that locates and makes visible your metadata or, if you choose, your actual data, apps and projects from around the world. It has common technical standards, safe guards, collection and analysis tools, to allow us to observe the web and use the intelligence it holds in new and exciting ways.
Researchers and developers from around the world are contributing their metadata, datasets,apps and tools to existing web observatories.</description>

      <title>Sharing Databases on the Web with Porter Proxy</title>
      <link>http://eugenesiow.com/publications/porter_proxy/</link>

      <description>Abstract With large number of datasets now available through the Web, data-sharing ecosystems such as the Web Observatory have emerged. The Web Observatory provides an active decentralised ecosystem for datasets and applications based on a number Web Observatory sites, each of which can run in a different administrative domain. On a Web Observatory site users can publish and securely access datasets across domains via a harmonised API and reverse proxies for access control.</description>

      <title>A Biological Internet: Building Eywa</title>
      <link>http://eugenesiow.com/talks/shenzhen_2017/</link>

      <description>Abstract In James Cameron&amp;rsquo;s Avatar, Eywa is the guiding force and deity of the world, Pandora. Eywa is like a huge biological internet; the trees being computer servers that store information and sensors being neural-connected flora and fauna making up the planets ecosystem. We study how this science fiction construct can be brought to life by our research on building the Social Web of Things with fog computing for decentralisation and workload distribution, Linked Data for interoperability and fast stream processing with storage and processing optimisations on lightweight computers.</description>

      <description>Abstract Resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices like Raspberry Pis&amp;rsquo;, with specific performance optimisation, can serve as interoperable personal Linked Data repositories for IoT applications. In this demo paper we describe PIOTRe, a personal datastore that utilises our sparql2sql query translation technology on Pis&amp;rsquo; to process, store and publish IoT time-series historical data and streams. We demonstrate with PIOTRe in a smart home scenario: a real-time dashboard that utilises RDF stream processing, a set of descriptive analytics visualisations on historical data, a framework for registering stream queries within a local network and a means of sharing metadata globally with HyperCat and Web Observatories.</description>

      <description>Abstract To realise a semantic Web of Things, the challenge of achieving efficient Resource Description Format (RDF) storage and SPARQL query performance on Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited resources has to be addressed. State-of-the-art SPARQL-to-SQL engines have been shown to outperform RDF stores on some benchmarks. In this paper, we describe an optimisation to the SPARQL-to-SQL approach, based on a study of time-series IoT data structures, that employs metadata abstraction and efficient translation by reusing existing SPARQL engines to produce Linked Data ‘just-in-time’.</description>

      <title>Interoperable &amp; Efficient: Linked Data for the Internet of Things</title>
      <link>http://eugenesiow.com/publications/iot_linked_data/</link>

      <guid>http://eugenesiow.com/publications/iot_linked_data/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Two requirements to utilise the large source of time-series sensor data from the Internet of Things are interoperability and efficient access. We present a Linked Data solution that increases interoperability through the use and referencing of common identifiers and ontologies for integration. From our study of the shape of Internet of Things data, we show how we can improve access within the resource constraints of Lightweight Computers, compact machines deployed in close proximity to sensors, by storing time-series data succinctly as rows and producing Linked Data ‘just-in-time’.</description>

      <description>A broad cross-IoT study of the characteristics of Things schemata and data streams. The aim of the study is to determine the flatness, width, types of attribute values and periodicity of current IoT data streams from various domains and use cases.
There are individual README.md files describing each of the datasets and the files within the dataset in more detail.

      <description>A collection of IoT schemata to determine the characteristics of IoT data. The focus was on whether IoT data was complex or flat, wide or narrow, numerical or non-numerical and even or unevenly spaced.
There were 22,662 schemata collected in Jan2016 of which 1,541 are empty and 9,561 are non-IoT schemata (dweet.zip).
Each schema is a .json file and they are classified into folders (complex, empty, flat).
Additional collected content (available in Apr 2017) of dweets is in another file called dweet_content.</description>

      <title>Facilitating data-driven innovation using VOICE observatory infrastructure</title>

      <description>Abstract Data is the new capital of the global economy and data analysis can increase efficiency and reduce costs for innovation. Finding and accessing both public and private data is essential to exploiting this data capital. In this paper we describe a platform, VOICE Observatory (VO), that provides an infrastructure and analytical resources to facilitate data-driven innovation. The VO curates a catalogue of analytical resources and provides secure access to them.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Interoperable: Linked Data for the Internet of Things</title>
      <link>http://eugenesiow.com/talks/rda_plenary_7/</link>

      <description>Poster Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services need data, which is collected from distributed and heterogeneous sensors, to be aggregated, integrated and interpreted in the context of other sources of information. Linked Data can facilitate this through the use of common identifiers, ontologies and self-describing semantics. However, storing sensor data as Linked Data is inefficient in terms of storage and query performance which is further exacerbated by the resource constraints of compact devices &amp;amp; hubs that are deployed in close proximity to sensors to perform this integration.</description>
