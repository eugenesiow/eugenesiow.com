A collection of IoT schemata to determine the characteristics of IoT data. The focus was on whether IoT data was complex or flat, wide or narrow, numerical or non-numerical and even or unevenly spaced.

There were 22,662 schemata collected in Jan2016 of which 1,541 are empty and 9,561 are non-IoT schemata (dweet.zip).
Each schema is a .json file and they are classified into folders (complex, empty, flat).

Additional collected content (available in Apr 2017) of dweets is in another file called dweet_content.zip.
Each set of content is a .json file.
