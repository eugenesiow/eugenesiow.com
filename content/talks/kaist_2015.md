### Event Information

I presented some of my work at the International Workshop of Social Machines for Disaster Management at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, Korea. KAIST is truly the MIT of South Korea! I had a great time interacting with the brilliant researchers there - social scientists, medical doctors, computer scientists and policy studies academics!
