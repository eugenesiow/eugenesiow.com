# About Me

The geek in me is a strange blend of engineer, designer and academic. I think it helps explain my desire to create solutions, with technology, that are simple, fast and beautiful.

**_Academic_** - I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Southampton](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/bles1g14) in the United Kingdom. My research involves making analytics  work for the Internet of Things and I think this involves a combination of distributed storage and processing, information fusion with Linked Data and analytical applications.

**_Engineer_** - I am from Singapore and am employed by the national defence research institute, [DSO National Laboratories](https://www.dso.org.sg/) as a Member of Technical Staff. Previously, my work was in the area of big data systems for maritime security. I hold a degree in Computer Engineering from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/award_commencement_halbrecht.html).

**_Designer_** - I like to think that I have an eye for aesthetics that drove my freelance design work in the past. My interest developed further into R&D and teaching in the area of User Experience, Human Computer Interaction and Human Factors Engineering. I am a proponent of minimalistic design and interfaces.

Outside of work, I enjoy mountain trekking, watching football, anime, [fantasy novels](https://www.goodreads.com/eugenesiow) and history.
