# About Me

The geek in me is a strange blend of engineer, designer and academic. I think it helps explain my desire to create solutions, with technology, that are simple, fast and beautiful.

**_Academic_** - I received my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Southampton](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/bles1g14) in the United Kingdom. My thesis, titled '[Efficient Querying for Analytics on Internet of Things Databases and Streams](../talks/defence_2017)', was about improving the scalability and performance of semantically interopeable graph queries across time-series data and graph-structured metadata for the IoT. I was supervised by [Dr Thanassis Tiropanis](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/tt2) and [Professor Dame Wendy Hall](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/wh).

**_Engineer_** - I am from Singapore and am employed by the national defence research institute, [DSO National Laboratories](https://www.dso.org.sg/) as a Senior Member of Technical Staff. I am the Chief Architect of the AI platform and infrastructure in DSO. I am currently working on Natural Language Processing, large-scale Machine Learning and AI, distributed systems and also serve as the tech lead for information-related capabilities. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked in the areas of big data systems and real-time maritime security systems. I hold a degree in Computer Engineering from the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) and am the receipient of the 2011-12 [Halbrecht Associates Book Prize](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/award_commencement_halbrecht.html) for the best graduating Honours student.

**_Designer_** - I like to think that I have an eye for aesthetics (I picked up a couple of web design awards back in my school days) and have done freelance design work in the past. My interest developed further into R&D and teaching in the area of User Experience, Human Computer Interaction and Human Factors Engineering in NUS. More recently, I've pioneered the development of web-scale visualisation frameworks for rapid data analytics at work. I am a proponent of minimalistic design and interfaces.

Outside of work, I enjoy mountain trekking, watching football and anime, [fantasy novels](https://www.goodreads.com/eugenesiow) and history.
